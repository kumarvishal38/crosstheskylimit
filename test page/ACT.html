It is a standardized test that is required to be taken by students looking for admission in undergraduate schools based in the US and Canada. ACT exam has been developed to evaluate the written, mathematical, verbal and scientific skills of the candidates.</P>
            <br>
            <p>In 2015, ACT test began to be offered as a computer-based test instead of the traditional paper-based test. The test syllabus, total score, and multiple choice format will not be affected by this change as only the test-taking format changes.</p>

            <h4>ACT Exam Pattern</h4>
            <br>
            <p>ACT exam pattern is as follows- four sections, namely, English, Math, Reading, and Science. There is an optional section which is called the Writing section, which has one 30-40 minute writing prompt that will define an issue, along with two points of view on that issue. Students are not scored on this section.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Scoring in ACT</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Each section of the ACT (English, Math, Reading, and Science) is scored on a 1 to 36 point scale. The composite score is the average of all four tests. Students taking the optional writing test will receive a writing score of that section ranging from 1 to 36. The writing score does not affect the composite score.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Here are the average ACT scores by sections -</h4>
            <p>English:

                20.3</p>
            <p>Math:

                20.9</p>
            <p>Reading:

                21.3</p>

            <p>Composite:

                </p>
            <br>
            <!-- <img src="img/ACT2.png"> -->
            <h4>ACT Score Validity</h4>
            <p>The ACT total scores are valid for five years after the testing year in which you tested.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Important Dates</h4>
            <p>The ACT is conducted only a few times a year between September to July. You do not have the luxury of selecting an exam date suitable as per your convenience, which is the case with other exams. You need to plan your exam prep according to these test dates. These exams are scheduled to suit your application deadlines for the fall semester. Check out the important dates for ACT in 2022 <a href="https://">here</a></p>
            <br>
            <h4>Points to remember:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Ideally, you are recommended to register for the exam two to three months before your choice of date for exam appearance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is safer to stick to early registration as you will have a set schedule to prepare for the exam accordingly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you consider taking coaching for exam preparation, the coaching institutes would also recommend you register at the earliest so that you have a wide window of time to prepare.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>ACT Preparation Tips</h4>
            <p>There are two ways to prepare for the ACT: Self-Study and Coaching Classes. Both these options have unique benefits and none of the above can be considered better than the other. These two methods cannot be compared as they serve different audiences. Choice of method of study would depend upon the requirements and preferences of the exam takers.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                Self-Study:
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p> If money is a consideration and one is quite confident of being able to prepare well without supervision, then self-study may be the better option to prepare for the ACT. You could save money on personal tuition and classes, but you need to keep in mind other factors too. To be able to study on your own effectively, you need a good resource of books and study material, along with motivation and self-discipline.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Coaching:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>If time is a constraint and you need professional guidance to ensure a competitive edge in exam preparation, then coaching classes are a better option. You will have access to a better resource of study material and will have a team of experts guiding you. Your time will be better managed as being regular to classes will become part of your routine. Moreover, being around other students preparing for the ACT will help you increase your motivation levels.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To choose the best method on how to prepare for ACT you first need to look at your criteria and decide accordingly. If you are confused and want to check whether or not you are ready to prepare o your own, you may refer to ACT Preparation Tips.</p>

The questions associated with this format measure skills like graph reading, interpretation of the information presented in tables, and interpretation of scatterplots.</p>
            <p>Research Summaries - This section provides descriptions of experiments. The questions focus on the design of experiments and the explanation of results.</p>
            <p>Conflicting Viewpoints - This section presents several hypotheses or views that might be based on differing premises or incomplete data, and are inconsistent with one another. The questions focus on the analysis, understanding, and comparison of alternative hypotheses.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All the best</p>
