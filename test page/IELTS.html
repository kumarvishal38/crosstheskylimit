                note down everything you said in the form of a transcript, this will help you identify errors faster.</p>

                - You should have a clear understanding of the entire framework of the IELTS examination. You
                should keep practicing with timed tests as mentioned. Keep in mind the time limit of the
                examination and the time limits for every module or section.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Develop your reading skills with care- You will be tested on your reading skills for aspects like
                information, primary thought, gist, skimming, understanding of any rational argument and also
