                <h2>CLUBS AND GROUPS</h2>
                <p>Clubs and groups are organizations that bring together people who share similar interests or goals. <br>
                    Clubs and groups can focus on a wide variety of interests, including academics, sports, hobbies,
                    social issues, and more. Some clubs and groups are organized around a specific subject or activity,
                    such as a math club or a gardening club, while others may be more general in nature, such as a
                    student council or a community service group. <br>
                    Joining a club or group can be a great way for students to get involved in their school or
                    community, meet new people, and explore their interests and passions. Clubs and groups can also
                    provide opportunities for students to develop new skills, such as leadership, teamwork, and
                    communication, and can be an important part of a student's overall education and development.
                    In general, clubs and groups are a way for people to come together to pursue shared interests or
                    goals, and can provide valuable experiences and opportunities for personal and social growth. <br>
<br>
                    Clubs and groups can be a great way to explore new interests, make new friends, and develop new
                    skills. If you're interested in starting or joining a club or group, there are a few things you
