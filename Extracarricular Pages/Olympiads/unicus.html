            <h2>What is Unicus Olympiads  </h2>
            <p>Unicus Olympiads are exams designed to foster a student's foundation and increase their curiosity. They aim to provide a platform for students to have a clear understanding of previous concepts, dig deeper into their studies, and prepare for future exams. Unicus Olympiads also encourage a pragmatic approach to problem-solving. They are held in the summer to avoid conflicting with the school curriculum. The name "Unicus" is Latin for "unique," and the goal of these Olympiads is to help students stand out and develop a competitive spirit.
